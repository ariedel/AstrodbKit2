AstrodbKit2 Documentation
*************************

AstrodbKit2 is an astronomical database handler code built on top of SQLAlchemy.
This is built to work with the `SIMPLE database <https://github.com/kelle/SIMPLE>`_, though
similarly constructed databases will work.

The idea behind this code is to provide SQLAlchemy's powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
infrastructure to access the database contents regardless of the underlying architecture.
